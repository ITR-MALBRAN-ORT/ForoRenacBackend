# Your app binds by default to port 8080, so you'll use the EXPOSE instruction to have it mapped by the docker daemon to:
EXPOSE $CONTAINER_PORT

# Define the command to run your app using CMD which defines your runtime. 
# Usually we will use node server.js, but now we use index.js to start demo server:
CMD [ "node", "dist/index.js" ]
